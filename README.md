# Prevent Awareness

Prevent Awareness is a site that hopes to inform the public of what the Prevent program is, and how it aims to counter radicalization and extremism. The site will be targeted to both people who might know an extremist, and people who fear that they themselves are being radicalized. The site aims to provide clear and accurate information with additional resources, and community engagement.

### Features Left to Implement

- Resources: external links to other organizations prevent workshops
	- It would be helpful to allow users to find other useful workshops about prevent such as online courses.
- Advice section: how to talk to your potential extremist friend
	- Not every case needs police intervention. Before contacting the police it is important to assess how extreme your friend is. It may also be possible to help deradicalise them if you have the correct approach. This section would attempt to answer these issues.
- Links to sections within the page
	- If we get to a point where our website involves a lot of scrolling, it may be worthwhile adding internal links to segments of the page.
- Resources: community initiatives
	- If after viewing our website a user would like to help stop extremism, we would include links to respectable community initiatives that band together to do just that.
  
## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  We agreed that a couple dark colours mixed with bright colours would work for our website. Including red was important to convey the danger of terrorism. The colours picked were generated the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/colour-palette/colourpalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Roboto condensed and Roboto fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they incorporate a lot of straight thick lines which comes across as oppressive. The fonts were tested for their effectiveness by how they made the word 'terrorism' look.
 
    ![Font Pairing](documentation/font-family/font-pair.png)   

-   ### Logo/Icon
    - The logo design incorporates a shield and binoculars. The shield because Prevent seeks to protect, and binoculars because Prevent needs to look closely to spot signs of radicalisation. The logo was generated using [bing copilot designer](https://www.bing.com/chat?q=Microsoft+Copilot&FORM=hpcodx)

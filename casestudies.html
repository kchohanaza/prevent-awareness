                                <p>Charlie was a year 12 student at college. He made racial comments while in college and openly talked about people of other religions and ethnicities, particularly Muslims, being a risk to white British people. He would cross the road away from people who he saw as a threat to him. The college referred him to Prevent.</p>
                                <p>The Channel coordinator of the local authority met with Charlie’s parents. They felt that his thoughts had come from the reporting of international terrorist attacks on television and social media. Charlie felt a sense of threat from a perceived risk of attack from Muslim people.</p>
                                <p>During the meeting, the parents produced a Nazi armband. They said Charlie had bought it when he met with National Front members who were allegedly recruiting people into their organisation. Charlie had gone there knowingly, after communicating online. Charlie told the Channel coordinator that he was a member of the Army cadets and that he played in a band.</p>

                                <p>Charlie’s parents were anxious about his behaviour and their relationship with him was tense. Children’s Social Care carried out an assessment of need.</p>
                                <p>A social worker liaised with child and adolescent mental health services as part of their assessment. They confirmed that Charlie had previously been medicated for anxiety, but he did not attend the service any more. The family had a negative relationship with services due to past experiences.</p>
                                <p>The Channel coordinator found an intervention provider with extreme right wing knowledge, as well as experience of supporting young people. The intervention provider had many sessions with Charlie and developed a trusting relationship early on.</p>

                                <p>The intervention was completed, and the family reported it had restored their faith in services.</p>
                                <p>The relationships within the family circle had improved and Charlie’s parents were confident that he was back on a safe pathway with a focus in life.</p>
                                <p>After 11 months, the case was closed. Charlie had stopped engaging with extreme right wing groups.</p>

                                <p>Alice was in year 11 at an independent secondary school. She had written a piece of English coursework in which she expressed extreme right wing views and glorified the Columbine shooters.</p>
                                <p>Alice felt the school had ignored the bullying she’d suffered in previous years and decided to take things into her own hands. She had a plan to ‘kill the protagonists and take out anyone else who got in her way’. She expressed this through her writing, which was articulate and referenced the Columbine attack.</p>

                                <p>The school spoke to Alice. She reassured them that she was not serious about her threat and was struggling with her mental health.</p>
                                <p>The school discussed this with her parents and asked the local authority Prevent team for informal advice. There were no other concerns about Alice and her mum was very supportive.</p>
                                <p>The school put in place an action plan to support Alice in her last term and shared this with the college she planned to attend. The college asked Alice’s mum how Alice felt about being at college. She said Alice was ‘loving college’.</p>
                                <p>Alice’s mum and the college agreed not to speak to Alice about what had happened at school. The college assured her mum that it had a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. Alice’s teachers were asked to look out for any changes in her behaviour and peer groups.</p>
                                <p>Alice’s progress coach made sure that regular one to one meetings were taking place. They also told her about the student led enrichment groups that were available. The college closely monitored Alice’s attendance and progression.</p>
                                <p>Alice joined the college’s debating society and creative writing society.</p>

                                <p>Alice’s family said she’d thrived and blossomed at college. Alice said she enjoyed having ‘safe’ places to discuss topical issues and to listen to different views.</p>
                                <p>There were no Prevent related concerns raised during Alice’s time at college.</p>
                                <p>Alice has since obtained an apprenticeship.</p>

                                <p>Abdu is in year 7 and has been subject to bullying in the past. He has one brother who he did not get on with, which made life difficult at home. His grandmother had recently passed away. He spent a lot of time on the internet unsupervised and had few opportunities to socialise with others.</p>
                                <p>Abdu made comments at school which suggested support for Daesh. He agreed with Daesh’s views, including their use of violence, and had a strong dislike of Christians. The school referred Abdu to Prevent.</p>
                                <p>Abdu’s parents were supportive but found it difficult to steer him away from the subject on which he had become fixated.</p>
                                <p>Abdu’s online activity involved watching beheading videos. The school felt that he was at risk of being groomed online.</p>

                                <p>The designated safeguarding lead (DSL) attended the Channel panel, taking a proactive approach and engaging with the process. Abdu’s parents were also very supportive.</p>
                                <p>Abdu was clearly vulnerable and the Channel panel adopted the case.</p>
                                <p>The Channel panel agreed upon an intervention provider to support Abdu. The intervention provider held monthly sessions with Abdu and was able to build a good relationship with him.</p>
                                <p>Other forms of support included going to a youth club, offered through the Youth Service, and the National Citizenship Scheme, which made sure Abdu was less isolated and improved his confidence. It also encouraged Abdu to develop personally and socially by working on skills like leadership, teamwork and communication.</p>

                                <p>Abdu’s first session with his intervention provider was very positive. The intervention provider was able to answer Abdu’s questions about his ideology and satisfy him with the answers.</p>
                                <p>Abdu felt less isolated, partly due to joining the Youth Service and the National Citizenship Service, but also support from the school and his parents.</p>
                                <p>Abdu was very grateful for the support he had received and commented that it had come to him ‘just in time’.</p>
                                <p>The case was eventually closed by the Channel panel, following a range of reviews to ensure positive sustainable outcomes moving forward.</p>
